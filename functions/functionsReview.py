FUNCTIONS
Review: Built-In Functions
Perfect! Last but not least, let's review the built-in functions you've learned about in this lesson.

def is_numeric(num):
  return type(num) == int or type(num) == float:

max(2, 3, 4) # 4
min(2, 3, 4) # 2

abs(2) # 2
abs(-2) # 2
1.
First, def a function called distance_from_zero, with one argument (choose any argument name you like).

If the type of the argument is either int or float, the function should return the absolute value of the function input.

Otherwise, the function should return "Nope"
