CONDITIONALS & CONTROL FLOW
Not
The boolean operator not returns True for false statements and False for true statements.

For example:

not False will evaluate to True, while not 41 > 40 will return False.
1.
Let's get some practice with not.

Set bool_one equal to the result of
not True
Set bool_two equal to the result of
not 3 ** 4 < 4 ** 3
Set bool_three equal to the result of
not 10 % 3 <= 10 % 2
Set bool_four equal to the result of
not 3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 != 5 ** 2
Set bool_five equal to the result of
not not False
