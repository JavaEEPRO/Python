CONDITIONALS & CONTROL FLOW
The Big If
Really great work! Here's what you've learned in this unit:

Comparators

3 < 4
5 >= 5
10 == 10
12 != 13
Boolean operators

True or False 
(3 < 4) and (5 >= 5)
this() and not that()
Conditional statements

if this_might_be_true():
  print "This really is true."
elif that_might_be_true():
  print "That is true."
else:
  print "None of the above."
Let's get to the grand finale.
1.
Write an if statement in the_flying_circus(). It must include:

if, elif, and else statements;
At least one of and, or, or not;
A comparator (==, !=, <, <=, >, or >=);
Finally, the_flying_circus() must return True when evaluated.
Don't forget to include a : after your if statements!
