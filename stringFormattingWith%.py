STRINGS & CONSOLE OUTPUT
String Formatting with %, Part 1
When you want to print a variable with a string, there is a better method than concatenating strings together.

name = "Mike"
print "Hello %s" % (name)
The % operator after a string is used to combine a string with variables. The % operator will replace a %s in the string with the string variable that comes after it.
